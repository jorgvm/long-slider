# Test

I've written this code as quick test to "rebuild a website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without external frameworks".

Since it's a test, I've only tested the project in Chrome (Mac + Android).
I'm simply including the JS files. Depending on your requirements you would normally first run it through Babel.

I wrote the "plugin" LongSlider, which does most of the work, for more info check out "longslider.js".

It's a very, very opinionated slider ;) not production ready obviously!
